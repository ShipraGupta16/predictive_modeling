# Predictive modeling

Aim of this work is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, and predictive modeling to gain insights into the relationship between multiple predictors (independent variables) and an outcome event (dependent variable) from a dataset.

Data: A Synthetic Splicing Dataset.

#### Introduction <br>
Gene splicing is a biological process that occurs in eukaryotic cells to generate functional messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules from the precursor RNA. The primary purpose of gene splicing is to remove non-coding regions (introns) and join the coding regions (exons) to create a mature mRNA molecule that can be translated into a protein. <br>

This analysis utilized a synthetic dataset containing the expressions of 3 splicing factors and a related splicing event across 100 subjects. The objective is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, and predictive modeling to gain insights into the relationships between splicing factors (predictors) and the splicing event (outcomes).
